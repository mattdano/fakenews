--data $'{"article":"WASHINGTON — The House voted to impeach President Donald Trump Wednesday after releasing hundreds of pages of text messages that point to clear evidence of obstruction of justice and communication with the head of the Trump Organization about a potential business deal in Russia. The 220-197 vote came after weeks of debate over whether new evidence released by special counsel Robert Mueller’s office signaled sufficient grounds for Trump’s removal from office. The president personally denounced the move, announcing his intent to veto the resolution and accusing Democrats of plotting to remove him from office through a “con job.”
“This is all a big con job,” he said during an appearance in Texas. “They got caught.”
A number of Democratic lawmakers went further, calling for Trump’s impeachment on the grounds that he obstructed justice. Democrats hold the House majority, and if the Senate fails to convict Trump, the president can be removed from office by a two-thirds vote.
But even with Trump’s political allies organizing from the White House, Republicans in the House stood united behind their leader, noting the historical difficulty of making the case for impeachment. “This is not a decision for the president,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. “It’s not one for this body, and I think it’s a dereliction of duty for the minority party to be making these calls.”
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday said they were not bound by Ryan’s defense. They released an 11-page joint report with Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that took a different tack, emphasizing that Mueller had not decided whether the case warranted impeachment. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the committee’s chairman, told reporters before the vote that he hoped the two reports would “send a clear message to the president that we in this body are not going to stand for obstruction of justice.” But when asked whether the report would build the case for impeachment, he said: “What’s far more likely to build a case for impeachment are the indictments and evidence produced through the special counsel’s work.”
On Tuesday night, the White House issued a statement proclaiming that the book by a former FBI deputy director, which has been cited by Democrats in support of impeachment, had been “made up and defamatory” to the president.
That statement drew swift and heavy rebukes from a number of Democrats, who said they had found the statement “beyond astonishing.”
The Democratic report, citing redacted text messages sent by former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok, revealed what the party called “a pattern of bias” and “an affinity for the Russian regime.”
The report did not include a full, uncensored text message Strzok sent to a friend after Trump was elected that said: “I’ll stop it.” That led Democrats to bemoan the language used, questioning what is or is not in the special counsel’s investigative file.
The report also quoted a review of emails and witness testimony to Mueller that said Trump “has obstructed justice in the Russia investigation” by firing FBI Director James Comey, by urging Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation and by urging his son, Donald Trump Jr., to meet with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in 2016.
“This has never happened in the history of our country,” Nadler said of the president. “No president has ever tried to interfere with an investigation into his own conduct.”
The vote was also led by Democrats who have been outspoken against Trump, including Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who took out  newspaper ads calling for the president’s impeachment. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., another outspoken Trump critic, said Trump’s ties to Russia were “becoming more and more ominous,” and said “as we go on, we are going to see if we can’t get the articles of impeachment out.”
Rep. Tony Cárdenas, D-Calif., a member of the Judiciary Committee, said many Democrats would be eager to see whether the newly discovered evidence could be used to support impeachment. “I think it will be the nail in the coffin of the ‘non-con,’” he said.","domain":"","date":"","authors":"","title":"","target":"discrimination"}' \
